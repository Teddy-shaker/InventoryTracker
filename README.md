# InventoryTracker
The InventoryTracker app provides a robust real-time inventory management system designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing products within a supermarket or any retail environment.

#Key Features:

-Add New Items: Users can quickly add new items to the inventory by entering product details such as name, category, supplier, quantity, and unit price. The app will automatically assign a unique identifier to each item.

-Update Existing Items: Users can update the details of existing inventory items, such as adjusting quantities after a new shipment or changing product information. This ensures that the inventory data remains accurate and up-to-date.

-Remove Items: The app allows users to remove obsolete or discontinued items from the inventory. This feature ensures that the inventory list remains clean and relevant.

-Search and Filter: Users can search for specific items using keywords or apply filters based on categories, suppliers, or stock levels. This feature helps users quickly find the items they need and manage the inventory more efficiently.

-Real-Time Stock Level Monitoring: The app continuously monitors the stock levels of all items and provides real-time updates. If an item's quantity falls below a predefined threshold, the app will notify the user, prompting them to reorder or restock the item.

-Detailed Reporting: The app generates detailed reports on inventory status, including current stock levels, low stock alerts, and value of the inventory. These reports can be exported for further analysis or shared with stakeholders.

-User-Friendly Interface: The app features an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, allowing users to manage inventory with minimal training. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the inventory, making it easy to track items at a glance.

Use Case Example:
Imagine a scenario where a supermarket receives a new shipment of goods. The inventory manager uses the app to add the new items to the inventory by entering the necessary details. Later, as items are sold, the app automatically updates the stock levels in real-time. If a particular item is running low, the app alerts the manager, ensuring that they can reorder in time to avoid stockouts.
